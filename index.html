        <h2>Why apartment is better than house?</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Lower Maintenance</span>
            <br />
            Apartments typically require less maintenance than houses. Landlords
            or property management companies often handle repairs and upkeep.

          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Cost-Effective </span>
            <br />Generally, apartments are less expensive than houses, both in
            terms of purchase price and monthly costs like utilities and
            property taxes. Also it's easy to make a decision to move other
            place

          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Security </span>
            <br />Many apartment buildings have security features, such as gated
            entrances and surveillance cameras, which can enhance safety.
