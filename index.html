            <span class="highlight">Lower Maintenance</span>
            <br />
            Apartments typically require less maintenance than houses. Landlords
            or property management companies often handle repairs and upkeep.

            <span class="highlight">Cost-Effective </span>
            <br />Generally, apartments are less expensive than houses, both in
            terms of purchase price and monthly costs like utilities and
            property taxes. Also it's easy to make a decision to move other
            place

          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Security </span>
            <br />Many apartment buildings have security features, such as gated
            entrances and surveillance cameras, which can enhance safety.

       <h4>Why house is better than apartment?</h4>

       <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="Brither">
          More space
          </span>
           
          <br>In general, houses offer more space, both indoors and outdoors (like a yard or garden), 
          which can be great for families, pets, or those who enjoy outdoor activities.

        <li>
          <span class="Brither">
          Privacy
          </span>
          <br>Houses usually provide more privacy, as there are no neighbors directly beside, above, or below, as in apartments.

        </li>
        
        <li>
          <span class="Brither">
          Freedom of customization
          </span>
          <br>Homeowners have more freedom to make renovations, change the décor, 
          and even build something new without the common restrictions found in condominiums.

        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="Brither">
          Outdoor area
          </span>
          <br>Having a garden or yard is a big advantage. 
          It allows for greater contact with nature, space to grow plants, or host outdoor events.

        </li>

        <li> 
          <span class="Brither">
          Fewer rules
          </span>
          <br>In an apartment, it's common to have condo regulations that limit what you can do, 
          like noise, renovations, and even pet ownership. In a house, these restrictions are usually fewer.

        <li>
          <span class="Brither">
          Parking and storage
          </span>
          <br>Many houses have their own garage and more space for storage,
           which can be a big benefit, especially for those with more than one car or larger equipment.
